# Automatic-Video-Summariser
Users can submit a YouTube video URL through a web form. The application downloads the video, transcribes the audio content using a speech recognition model. The transcribed text is then summarized using a transformer-based summarization model. Users can download the generated summary as a text file or view it directly on the webpage.
